# e-commerce-web-scrapping
My first web scraping project, collecting product data (names, prices, stock status) from an e-commerce site. It explores how real-world data can drive insights and improve business strategies. Combining Python and data visualization, this project is my first step into data-driven decision-making and analytics.
